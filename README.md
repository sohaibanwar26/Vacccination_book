## Background
<p style="text-align:justify;"> During April 2021, students were asked to gradually return to take classes/labs on the campus at Sunway University, Malaysia after a year of online classes. However one of the main requirements was that each individual entering the campus had to be vaccinated and there was no central database for checking how many students had been vaccinated from each department/school. During that semester I was taking the Object Oriented Programming course where for the first time we were introduced to working with large-scale data and maintaining backend functionality for applications using Scala Language. So as a project, I attempted to build a simple desktop application using Scalafx called Sunway Vaccination Logbook, where students could enter details about their StudentID, FirstName, VaccinationDate, Type etc. </p> This project was later implemented on a larger scale by the Sunway education group where student were allotted smart cards that would need to tap in before entering the campus and then details of their of respective students would show up in the system.
