## Background
<p style="text-align:justify;"> During April 2021, students were asked to gradually return to take classes/labs in campus at Sunway University, Malaysia after a year of online classes. However one of the main requirements was that each individual entering the campus had to be vaccinated and there was no central database for checking how many people had been vaccinated from each department/school. During that semester I was taking the Object Oriented Programming course where for the first time we were introduced to working with large-scale data and maintaining backend functionality for applications using Scala Language. So as a project, I attempted to build a simple desktop application using Scalafx called Sunway Vaccination Logbook, where students could enter details about StudentID, FirstName, VaccinationDate, Type etc. </p>
